# Firearms Map

This repository contains two items:

1. In the master branch you'll find a Python script that converts ATF FFL Excel spreadsheets to JSON.
2. In the gh-pages branch you'll find a basic website that uses the JSON generated by (1) to show a map of FFL data.

The map currently shows a subset of FFLs in Pennsylvania. You can download ATF FFL data at
