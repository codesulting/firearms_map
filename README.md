# Firearms Map

This repository contains two items:

1. In the master branch you'll find a Python script that converts ATF FFL Excel spreadsheets to JSON.
2. In the gh-pages branch you'll find a basic website that uses the JSON generated by (1) to show a map of FFL data.

The map currently shows a subset of FFLs in Pennsylvania. You can download ATF FFL data at 
[https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees).

## Using this Code

This work is being used in Pennsylvania to organize a grassroots effort to combat Bloomberg's financial interference in elections. Check out the site in the gh-pages branch for more. You can start an effort in your state by building on what we've created. This can be as simple as (1) forking this repository, (2) updating the FFL data to be the data for your own state, and (3) changing the names from Pennsylvania to your state's name. Do not forget to also use your own email address.

Here are other things we've done:

* We bought a domain name using [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) and [configured](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages) it to point to our GitHub page.

* We set-up a free account with [ZoHo](https://www.zoho.com/) and use it for `@domainname.com` email addresses. ZoHo requires a working phone number to receive an activation code via SMS. We used a Google Voice number.

* We backup our data so that it is easily transported to other services if necessary.
