    <div id="intro">Pennsylvanians! Former NY City Mayor and current presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg has <a
        href="https://www.ccrkba.org/ccrkba-warns-bloomberg-bought-virginia-now-hes-trying-to-buy-u-s/">committed $60
        million</a> to the cause of turning more than a dozen currently pro-grun states anti-gun in 2020. Pennsylvania
      is
      near the top of his hit list. This is a presidential election year with many state-level elections. 60 million
      dollars goes extremely far in local elections. Bloomberg spent $2.5 million to flip <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VAGuns/">Virginia</a> from being equivalent to Pennsylvania to equivalent to
      California in terms of <a href="https://vcdl.org/">our second amendment rights</a>. Now is the time for action!
    </div>

    <br>

    <div id="nextstep">Bloomberg is worth $50 billion. We cannot outspend him. We cannot bankrupt him. However, we can
      outvote him!</div>

    <br>

    <div id="plan">Based on the hypothesis that most gun owners visit at least a gun store or a gun club several times a
      year, the Pennsylvania Committee of Correspondence proposes we organize these groups to spread the message that we
      must vote if we do not want to fight. This webpage exists to present potential members of the Committee of
      Correspondence and we need your helping including them. Visit your local gray map markers, explain the situation,
      and ask them to join the Committee of Correspondence today! All they have to do is provide a point of contact,
      receive three points of information building up to the election, and share this information with every potential
      pro-gun voter they come into contact with. <a href="mailto:info@pagunvote.com">Email us</a> (1) when you've
      contacted a gray marker, (2) when they've agreed to be included and provided an email address, or (3) refuse to
      join
      our efforts to protect our rights. When you email us about a specific marker (include the address in your email)
      we'll update the marker in our map.

      <br><br>

      It is important that you email us for any one of those cases. With a collection of email addresses belonging to
      supporters, we'll turn the wheels of victory by:

      <ol class="centered-list">
        <li>Emailing the committee information about registering to vote.</li>
        <li>Emailing the committee the <a href="https://foac-pac.org/">FOAC</a> Voter Guide for 2020 when it is ready.
        </li>
        <li>Emailing the committee information about when and where to vote.</li>
      </ol>

      Committee members will take this data and spread it to every pro-gun voter they can find, be it neighbors,
      friends,
      customers, colleagues, etc.

        <div id="conclusion">If we band together we can win. Let's turn this entire map green!</div>
